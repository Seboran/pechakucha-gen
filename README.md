# Rust pechakucha generator

This project allows you to create a pechakucha presentation from a list of pictures in a folder, sorted in lexicographic order.

```sh
pechakucha-gen ./your_folder
```

**By default** the project deletes everything in the `output` folder where you run the CLI.

To run you presentation, you can use;

```sh
pnpm dlx serve output
```
