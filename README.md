# Rust pechakucha generator

This project allows you to create a pechakucha presentation from a list of pictures in a folder, sorted in lexicographic order.

```sh
pechakucha-gen <your_folder> <output_folder>
```

**By default** the project deletes everything in the `output_folder` folder you provide to the CLI.

To run you presentation, you can open the file pechakucha.html. Beware, it starts as soon as you open the file.
